# Abstract 
This work will introduce a Collaborative Book Recommendation System using two popular techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF) methods such as correlation and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The proposed system aims to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and historical data. The KNN algorithm identifies similar users and recommends books based on their reading habits. Additionally, the Matrix Factorization approach, including correlation and SVD, is used to extract latent features from the user-item matrix, enabling accurate predictions of user preferences. The combination of these techniques results in an effective collaborative book recommendation system that enhances user satisfaction and engagement.
